                    Until 1795, the Place Guillaume II was home to a monastery of Franciscan monks, At the time, Luxembourg's town hall was the current Grand Ducal Palace, located just to the east of Place Guillaume II, on Krautmaart.[1] The French invasion during the French Revolutionary War heralded a seizure of the monastery, and the beginning of the use of the Grand Ducal Palace for central government purposes.[1] As a result, for three decades, the municipal headquarters were moved around the city, without adequate accommodation.[1]
                    Ever since Napoleon had given the site of the monastery to the city, plans had been afoot to build a purpose-built city hall.[1] These plans finally came to fruition in 1828, when a design by Liège-based Justin Rémont was given the go-ahead.[1] The following year, the old monastery, which had fallen into disrepair, was deconstructed, with much of the material going towards building the new city hall, construction of which began in 1830.[1] Construction continued through the Belgian Revolution, with Luxembourg City (protected by its German garrison) remaining the only part of the Grand Duchy outside the control of the rebel forces.
